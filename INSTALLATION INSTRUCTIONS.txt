UltimatePlugin Installation Instructions:
-----------------------------------------

First of all, I would like to thank you for using UltimatePlugin. You have made a good choice!
Now for the installation instructions, please look below.
Note: UltimatePlugin now supports amxmodx 1.8.2 and amxmodx 1.8.3. While it will work on both,
using this plugin on amxmodx 1.8.3 is gonna be faster, you will not notice the difference.

In this .zip file you will find everything you need to make the plugin work on your server. You only
need to do two small steps.
1. Download a copy of UltimatePlugin.amxx and UltimatePluginMenu.amxx from the alliedmods. To do
   so, click on 'Get Plugin' for both files (UltimatePlugin.sma and UltimatePluginMenu.sma)
   Note: if you have amxmodx 1.8.3, you will need to compile the plugin locally because the web
   compiler is on 1.8.2 at the writing of this post.
2. Place those two files in the 'addons/amxmodx/plugins' folder.
3. Extract and copy all the files to their respective folders. In the .zip file, everything is in
   the correct folder, so all you have to do is merge to the folders together, and you are done.
4. Last but not least, go to the following file: 'addons/amxmodx/configs/plugins.ini'. Now look for
   the following line: 'adminchat.ammx'. After you locate that line, add directly ABOVE it the following:
   'UltimatePlugin.sma'. Then add at the very bottom of the file the following: 'UltimatePluginMenu.amxx'
   Note: do NOT include the quotes when writing them.
   
Now the plugins is installed. For the changes to take effect, you will need to restart your server, or 
simply change the map.


ATTENTION: you might ask, why are there 3 language files? The answer is simple, some players do not
like greeen chat messages, therefore they have the opportunity to change that in the source code.
If '#define GREEN_CHAT 1' is commented, on the prefix is set in green color, else it is colored.
